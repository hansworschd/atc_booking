# atc_booking
Just some bad written php code to see VATSIM bookings...

This is a fork of the atc_booking project, original project available at [https://github.com/hansworschd/atc_booking](https://github.com/hansworschd/atc_booking)

## Installation
Just copy the files to a php 7.x server. 
Add `MyriadProRegular.ttf` in the main folder of this application to get nicer view.
If not the default font will be used.
